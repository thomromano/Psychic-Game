# Psychic-Game
A JavaScript game where the user must guess the letter the computer is thinking of.

This simple game uses JavaScript to select a random letter. Using the keyboard, 
the user has up to 9 chances to guess the correct letter.
If the user is unable to guess the letter after 9 tries, the game will reset
and the user will have the opportunity to try again.

This repository is maintained by myself. It is for JavaScript practice,
and may be updated or changed at any time. If you become aware of any issues, bugs, etc. 
please message me directly or leave a comment. Thanks.
